# Predicting-Disaster-Survivals-with-Classification-Models
This repository focuses on predicting the survival rate of individuals in a disaster scenario using various classification algorithms. The project encompasses data cleaning, wrangling, and encoding techniques to preprocess the dataset, making it suitable for machine learning.
Handled missing values, outliers to enhance the data quality.
Implemented Algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost to analyze the model performance.
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize predictive accuracy and enhance model performance.
